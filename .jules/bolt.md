## 2026-06-08 - [Worker Name Collision — apex serves dashboard]
**Learning:** Renaming root `wrangler.jsonc` worker from `agent-memory` to `hystersis-app` (PR #85) collided with `dashboard/wrangler.jsonc`. Dashboard deploy overwrote landing; `hystersis.com` redirected to `/auth/signin`.
**Action:** Keep worker names unique: `agent-memory` (landing) vs `hystersis-app` (dashboard). Do not deploy dashboard from `build-cloudflare.sh`. See `.github/MULTI_AGENT_COORDINATION.md` before parallel agent edits.

## 2026-06-06 - [Batch Metadata Retrieval]
**Learning:** Identified a classic N+1 query bottleneck in the `SearchMemories` method where metadata for each result was fetched individually. This resulted in significant latency proportional to the number of search results.
**Action:** Use batch retrieval methods like `GetMemoriesByIDs` to fetch all metadata in a single round-trip to the database. Always check for bulk retrieval opportunities when processing collections of identifiers.

## 2026-06-10 - [Batch Embedding & Parallel Search]
**Learning:** Sequential API calls for embeddings and vector searches in expanded query scenarios (PGR) create a major bottleneck. Batching embeddings and parallelizing searches significantly reduces retrieval latency from O(N) to roughly O(1) in terms of round-trip times.
**Action:** Always batch LLM/Embedding API calls when multiple inputs are available. Use goroutines for independent I/O-bound operations like vector searches.
